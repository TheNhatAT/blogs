###### I'm currently ...
- working as a software engineer (focus on backend) at [DNSE](https://www.dnse.com.vn/) (Hanoi, Vietnam)
- reading a lot of waiting books in my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/159097002-brian-nguyen) -  actually i do not update my list until done the book
- falling into my rabbit hole (literature, philosophy, psychology, history, memoir, engineering, etc) in the weekend
###### I'm excited about ...
- software engineering's aspects: database, distributed system, concurrency programming, etc
- the deep thinking and connection that occur when people communicate
- understanding both old & new things that make us realise that we are still a little part of the world <br>
 <br>
*If any of those resonate, please reach out!*

*I'm considering myself as a reader - kinda little shy when said it. Please don't hesitate when you wanna ask me something, sharing is the best way for learning!*
